// Arena allocator inspired by Zig's std.heap.ArenaAllocator.
// It's like any ordinary arena allocator, but it can do some extra things:
// - free the most recent allocation (stack-based allocations)
// - grow indefinitely (up until the root allocator stops giving up bytes)

// This one in particular is optimized for a large number of small allocations - very large allocations (larger than say 100kib) should be rare.

// Differences from the Zig version:
// - This allocates the smallest number of needed fixed size blocks instead of creating buffers 1.5x the size of the requested allocation
//     - this decision was made on the assumption that the underlying allocator is optimized for aspecific large allocation size (which is the case for a raw OS page alloc)

// TODO(bluesillybeard): Make some proper tests for this arena allocator so we know it works reliably and consistently

// memory block, minus two size_t's worth of bytes for some metadata. Effectively a linked list.
struct grug_arena_block {
    // the full size of this block. Will be a multiple of the block size.

    struct grug_arena_block* empty_blocks;
    // The allocator will only allocate from the last block.
    // So instead of storing the used amount for each block, we store it once for the 'surface' or 'top' block that we allocate from.
    // It does not include the space taken up by the block struct itself.
